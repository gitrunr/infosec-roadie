# Infosec Roadie

Since 2020, I decided to get involved in the social aspect of the infosec community through volunteering. During Defcon, after volunteering at BSides Las Vegas, a goon gave me an "Infosec Roadie" sticker:

"Because you are not a rockstar, you are a roadie: you keep the show running."

It struck a nerve and I now happily wear this hat.
